# 🚗Vehicle Tracking System using IoT

## 📌Overview
The Vehicle Tracking System using IoT is designed to monitor and track vehicles in real time using GPS, GSM, and cloud technology. The system collects location data from the vehicle and transmits it to a remote server or cloud platform, enabling users to track the vehicle’s movement via a web or mobile application.
## 🔧Features
✔️ Real-time tracking with GPS

✔️ Geofencing to define safe zones

✔️ Cloud integration for remote access

✔️ User-friendly dashboard for visualization

## 🛠️Components Required
-IoT Hardware: GPS Module (Neo-6M), Microcontroller (ESP32), OLED Module

-Software: Arduino IDE(Embedded C)

-Cloud: BLynk IoT

-Data Visualization: Web Dashboard / Mobile App

## 🚀 How It Works
1. GPS module captures vehicle coordinates.

2. Microcontroller processes data and sends it via GSM.

3. Cloud platform stores data for real-time tracking.

4. User accesses vehicle location via a web dashboard or mobile app.
